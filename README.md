Integrated Data-driven Inference and Planning-based Human Motion Prediction for Safe Human-Robot Interaction

# Overall Architecture  
![algorithm_](https://github.com/HMCL-UNIST/IntegratedMotionPrediction/assets/86097031/8e75b2f7-6857-4063-b1b4-4c5a2e2c0058)

We develop the algorithm for a autonomous vehicle to safely and actively interact with an uncertain human-driven vehicle.
The algorithm combines:
  -  A hierarchical prediction strategy that integrates data-driven human internal state inference with planning-based human motion prediction
  -  An Active motion planning algorithm for the autonomous vehicle to ensure safety against uncertain human motions
